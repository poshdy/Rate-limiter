What are we going to build 
an API rate limiter with token bucket algorithm

what is the idea behind that?

besides the business rules as a best practice for security and performance of your api 
you should put a rate limiter middleware

rate limiter in theory do a simple job

track the requests from users in fixed period of time 
ex maxium api calls in 1 min is 3 calls 
30 tweets per day

so the limiter prevent users from overuse the endpoint
